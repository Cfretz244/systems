       _G_N_U  _E_m_a_c_s is a version of _E_m_a_c_s, written by the author of the original
       (PDP-10) _E_m_a_c_s, Richard Stallman.
       The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is  in  the  GNU  Emacs  Manual,
       which  you  can  read  using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone
       program.  Please look there for complete and up-to-date  documentation.
       This  man  page  is  updated only when someone volunteers to do so; the
       Emacs maintainers’ priority goal is to minimize the amount of time this
       man page takes away from other more useful projects.
       The  user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything other _E_m_a_c_s
       editors do, and it is easily extensible since its editing commands  are
       written in Lisp.

       _E_m_a_c_s  has  an  extensive  interactive  help facility, but the facility
       assumes that you know how to  manipulate  _E_m_a_c_s  windows  and  buffers.
       CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) starts
       an interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the  fundamentals  of
       _E_m_a_c_s  in a few minutes.  Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a com-
       mand given its functionality, Help Character  (CTRL-h  c)  describes  a
       given  character’s  effect,  and  Help  Function (CTRL-h f) describes a
       given Lisp function specified by name.

       _E_m_a_c_s’s Undo can undo several steps of modification to your buffers, so
       it is easy to recover from editing mistakes.

       _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s’s many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and send-
       ing (Mail), outline editing  (Outline),  compiling  (Compile),  running
       subshells  within _E_m_a_c_s windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print
       loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode),  automated  psychotherapy  (Doctor),  and
       much more.

       There  is  an  extensive  reference  manual, but users of other Emacses
       should have little trouble adapting even without a copy.  Users new  to
       _E_m_a_c_s will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly by studying the
       tutorial and using the self-documentation features.

                      The same as specifying _f_i_l_e directly as an argument.

              ++_n_u_m_b_e_r Go to the line specified by  _n_u_m_b_e_r  (do  not  insert  a
                      space  between  the  "+"  sign  and  the  number).  This
                      applies only to the next file specified.

              ++_l_i_n_e_:_c_o_l_u_m_n
                      Go to the specified _l_i_n_e and _c_o_l_u_m_n.

                      Use specified _f_i_l_e as  the  terminal  instead  of  using
                      stdin/stdout.  This must be the first argument specified
                      in the command line.

              ----mmuullttiibbyyttee, ----nnoo--uunniibbyyttee

       The following options are useful when running _E_m_a_c_s as a batch editor:

              ----bbaattcchh Edit  in  batch  mode.  The editor will send messages to
                      stderr.  This option must be the first in  the  argument
                      list.   You  must use -l and -f options to specify files
                      to execute and functions to call.

              ----ssccrriipptt _f_i_l_e
                      Run _f_i_l_e as an Emacs Lisp script.

       _E_m_a_c_s  has been tailored to work well with the X window system.  If you
       run _E_m_a_c_s from under X windows, it will create its own X window to dis-
       play  in.   You  will probably want to start the editor as a background
       process so that you can continue using your original window.

       _E_m_a_c_s can be started with the following X switches:

              ----nnaammee _n_a_m_e
                      Specify the name which should be assigned to the initial
                      _E_m_a_c_s  window.   This controls looking up X resources as
                      well as the window title.

              --TT _n_a_m_e, ----ttiittllee _n_a_m_e
                      Specify the title for the initial X window.

              --rr, --rrvv, ----rreevveerrssee--vviiddeeoo
                      Display the _E_m_a_c_s window in reverse video.

              --ffnn _f_o_n_t, ----ffoonntt _f_o_n_t
                      Set the _E_m_a_c_s window’s font to that specified  by  _f_o_n_t.
                      You   will   find   the   various   _X   fonts   in   the
                      _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1_/_f_o_n_t_s directory.  Note that _E_m_a_c_s will only
                      accept fixed width fonts.  Under the X11 Release 4 font-
                      naming conventions, any font with the value "m"  or  "c"
                      in  the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed width
                      font.  Furthermore, fonts whose name  are  of  the  form
                      _w_i_d_t_hx_h_e_i_g_h_t  are  generally fixed width, as is the font
                      _f_i_x_e_d.  See xxllssffoonnttss(1) for more information.

                      When you specify a font, be sure to put a space  between
                      the switch and the font name.

              ----xxrrmm _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s
                      Set additional X resources.

              ----ccoolloorr, ----ccoolloorr==_m_o_d_e
                      Override   color  mode  for  character  terminals;  _m_o_d_e
                      defaults to ‘auto’, and can  also  be  ‘never’,  ‘auto’,
                      ‘always’, or a mode name like ‘ansi8’.

              --bbww _p_i_x_e_l_s, ----bboorrddeerr--wwiiddtthh _p_i_x_e_l_s
                      Set  the  _E_m_a_c_s  window’s  border width to the number of
                      pixels specified by _p_i_x_e_l_s.  Defaults to  one  pixel  on
                      each side of the window.

              --iibb _p_i_x_e_l_s, ----iinntteerrnnaall--bboorrddeerr _p_i_x_e_l_s
                      Set  the window’s internal border width to the number of
                      pixels specified by _p_i_x_e_l_s.  Defaults to  one  pixel  of
                      padding on each side of the window.

              --gg _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y, ----ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
                      Set  the  _E_m_a_c_s  window’s width, height, and position as
                      specified.  The geometry specification is in  the  stan-
                      dard X format; see XX(7) for more information.  The width
                      and height are specified in characters; the  default  is
                      80  by  24.   See the Emacs manual, section "Options for
                      Window Size and Position", for information on how window
                      sizes  interact  with  selecting or deselecting the tool
                      bar and menu bar.

              --ffww, ----ffuullllwwiiddtthh
                      Make the first frame as wide as the screen.

              --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r, ----ffoorreeggrroouunndd--ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
                      On color displays, set the color of the text.

                      Use the command _M_-_x _l_i_s_t_-_c_o_l_o_r_s_-_d_i_s_p_l_a_y for  a  list  of
                      valid color names.

                      On color displays, set the color of the window’s border.

              --ccrr _c_o_l_o_r, ----ccuurrssoorr--ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
                      On  color  displays,  set the color of the window’s text
                      cursor.

              --mmss _c_o_l_o_r, ----mmoouussee--ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
                      On color displays, set the color of the  window’s  mouse
                      cursor.

              --dd _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_n_a_m_e, ----ddiissppllaayy _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_n_a_m_e
                      Create the _E_m_a_c_s window on the display specified by _d_i_s_-
                      _p_l_a_y_n_a_m_e.  Must be the first  option  specified  in  the

                      Tell  _E_m_a_c_s  not  to use its special interface to X.  If
                      you use this switch when invoking _E_m_a_c_s from an xxtteerrmm(1)
                      window, display is done in that window.

              --DD, ----bbaassiicc--ddiissppllaayy
                      This  option  disables many display features; use it for
                      debugging Emacs.

       You can set _X default values for your _E_m_a_c_s windows in your _._X_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_s
       file (see xxrrddbb(1)).  Use the following format:

              emacs._k_e_y_w_o_r_d:_v_a_l_u_e

       where _v_a_l_u_e specifies the default value of _k_e_y_w_o_r_d.  _E_m_a_c_s lets you set
       default values for the following keywords:

              bbaacckkggrroouunndd (class BBaacckkggrroouunndd)

MMAANNUUAALLSS
       You can order printed copies of the GNU  Emacs  Manual  from  the  Free
       Software  Foundation, which develops GNU software.  See the file ORDERS
       for ordering information.
       Your local Emacs maintainer might also have copies available.  As  with
       all  software  and publications from FSF, everyone is permitted to make
       and distribute copies of the Emacs manual.  The TeX source to the  man-
       ual is also included in the Emacs source distribution.

FFIILLEESS
       /usr/local/share/info  — files for the Info documentation browser.  The
       complete text of the Emacs reference manual is included in a convenient
       tree  structured  form.  Also includes the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual,
       useful to anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp  extension
       language.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp  —  Lisp source files and compiled
       files that define most editing commands.  Some  are  preloaded;  others
       are autoloaded from this directory when used.

       /usr/local/libexec/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH  —  various  programs  that are
       used with GNU Emacs.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc — various files of information.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* — contains the  documentation
       strings  for  the  Lisp  primitives and preloaded Lisp functions of GNU
       Emacs.  They are stored here to reduce the size of Emacs proper.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people offering vari-
       ous  services  to assist users of GNU Emacs, including education, trou-
       bleshooting, porting and customization.

BBUUGGSS
       There is a mailing list,  bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org,  for  reporting  Emacs
       bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try to
       be sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate
       feature.   We ask you to read the section ‘‘Reporting Emacs Bugs’’ near
       the end of the reference manual (or Info system) for hints on  how  and
       when to report bugs.  Also, include the version number of the Emacs you
       are running in _e_v_e_r_y bug report that you send in.  Bugs  tend  actually
       to  be  fixed  if  they  can  be isolated, so it is in your interest to
       report them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.

       Do not expect a personal answer  to  a  bug  report.   The  purpose  of
       reporting  bugs  is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release,
       if possible.  For personal assistance, look in the  SERVICE  file  (see
       above) for a list of people who offer it.

       Please  do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.  For
       more  information   about   Emacs   mailing   lists,   see   the   file
       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/MAILINGLISTS.

       _E_m_a_c_s  is free; anyone may redistribute copies of _E_m_a_c_s to anyone under
       the terms stated in the _E_m_a_c_s General Public License, a copy  of  which
       accompanies  each copy of _E_m_a_c_s and which also appears in the reference
       manual.

       Copies of _E_m_a_c_s may sometimes be received packaged  with  distributions
       of  Unix  systems, but it is never included in the scope of any license
       covering those systems.  Such inclusion violates  the  terms  on  which
       distribution is permitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the General
       Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other  restric-
       tions to redistribution of _E_m_a_c_s.

       Richard  Stallman encourages you to improve and extend _E_m_a_c_s, and urges
       that you contribute your extensions to the GNU library.  Eventually GNU
       (Gnu’s  Not  Unix)  will  be a complete replacement for Unix.  Everyone
       will be free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.
