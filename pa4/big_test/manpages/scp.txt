     ssccpp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), ssccpp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
     they are needed for authentication.

     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the
     file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid ssccpp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts
     are also permitted.

     When copying a source file to a target file which already exists, ssccpp
     will replace the contents of the target file (keeping the inode).

     If the target file does not yet exist, an empty file with the target file
     name is created, then filled with the source file contents.  No attempt
     is made at "near-atomic" transfer using temporary files.

     The options are as follows:

     --11      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 1.

     --22      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 2.

     --44      Forces ssccpp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces ssccpp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --BB      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     --CC      Compression enable.  Passes the --CC flag to ssh(1) to enable com-
             pression.

     --cc _c_i_p_h_e_r
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --FF _s_s_h___c_o_n_f_i_g
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for sssshh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --ii _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y___f_i_l_e
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     --ll _l_i_m_i_t
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     --oo _s_s_h___o_p_t_i_o_n
             Can be used to pass options to sssshh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate ssccpp command-line flag.  For full details of
             the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     --PP _p_o_r_t
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because --pp is already
             reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in
             rcp(1).

     --pp      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
             original file.

     --qq      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     --rr      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that ssccpp follows sym-
             bolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     --SS _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
             Name of _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
             must understand ssh(1) options.

     --vv      Verbose mode.  Causes ssccpp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
             about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.

     The ssccpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

IIPPVV66
     IPv6 address can be used everywhere where IPv4 address. In all entries
     must be the IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets. Note: The square
     brackets are metacharacters for the shell and must be escaped in shell.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     ssccpp is based on the rcp(1) program in BSD source code from the Regents of
     the University of California.
