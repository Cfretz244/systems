          options
             Command-line options. See _O_p_t_i_o_n_s.

          class
             The name of the class to be called.

          file.jar
             The  name  of  the JAR file to be called. Used only with the --jjaarr
             command.

          argument
             The arguments passed to the mmaaiinn function.



DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The jjaavvaa command starts a Java application. It does this by starting  a
       Java  runtime  environment, loading a specified class, and calling that
       class’s mmaaiinn method.


       The method must be declared public and static, it must not  return  any
       value,  and  it  must  accept a String array as a parameter. The method
       declaration has the following form:


       ppuubblliicc ssttaattiicc vvooiidd mmaaiinn((SSttrriinngg aarrggss[[]]))




       By default, the first argument without an option is  the  name  of  the
       class to be called. A fully qualified class name should be used. If the
       --jjaarr option is specified, then the first  non-option  argument  is  the
       name of a JAR file containing class and resource files for the applica-
       tion, with the startup  class  indicated  by  the  Main-Class  manifest
       header.


       The  Java  runtime  searches  for  the startup class, and other classes
       used, in three  sets  of  locations:  the  bootstrap  class  path,  the
       installed extensions, and the user class path.


       Non-option  arguments  after the class name or JAR file name are passed
       to the mmaaiinn function.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The launcher has a set of standard options that are  supported  in  the
       current runtime environment.


       In  addition,  the current implementations of the virtual machines sup-
       port a set of nonstandard options that are subject to change in  future
       releases. See _N_o_n_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _O_p_t_i_o_n_s.

          -client
             Selects  the  Java  HotSpot  Client VM. A 64-bit capable JDK cur-
             rently ignores this option and  instead  uses  the  Java  Hotspot
             Server VM.

          -server
             Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. On a 64-bit capable JDK, only
             the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported so the --sseerrvveerr option  is
             implicit.

             form/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting

          -classpath classpath, -cp classpath
             Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP  archives  to
             search  for  class files. Separate class path entries with colons
             (:). Specifying --ccllaassssppaatthh or --ccpp overrides any  setting  of  the
             _C_L_A_S_S_P_A_T_H environment variable.
             If --ccllaassssppaatthh and --ccpp are not used and _C_L_A_S_S_P_A_T_H is not set, then
             the user class path consists of the current directory (.).
             As a special convenience, a class path element  that  contains  a
             base  name  of ** is considered equivalent to specifying a list of
             all the files in the directory with the extension .jar or .JAR. A
             Java  program  cannot tell the difference between the two invoca-
             tions.
             For example, if directory mydir contains a.jar  and  b.JAR,  then
             the  class  path  element  mmyyddiirr//**  is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR,
             except that the order of jar files is unspecified. All jar  files
             in the specified directory, even hidden ones, are included in the
             list. A class path entry consisting simply of ** expands to a list
             of  all  the  jar  files  in the current directory. The _C_L_A_S_S_P_A_T_H
             environment variable, where defined, will be similarly  expanded.
             Any  class  path  wildcard expansion occurs before the Java VM is
             started. No Java program will ever see wild cards  that  are  not
             expanded  except  by  querying  the  environment. For example, by
             calling SSyysstteemm..ggeetteennvv((""CCLLAASSSSPPAATTHH"")).

          -Dproperty=value
             Sets a system property value.

          -d32
             Run the application in a 32-bit environment. If a 32-bit environ-
             ment  is  not  installed  or  is  not supported, an error will be
             reported. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environ-
             ment unless a 64-bit only system is used.

          -d64
             Run the application in a 64-bit environment. If a 64-bit environ-
             ment is not installed or is  not  supported,  an  error  will  be
             reported. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environ-
             ment unless a 64-bit only system is used.
             Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports 64-bit  opera-
             tion,  and  the  --sseerrvveerr option is implicit with the use of --dd6644.
             The --cclliieenntt option is ignored with the use of --dd6644. This is  sub-
             ject to change in a future release.

          -disableassertions[:package  name"..." | :class name ], -da[:package
          name"..." | :class name ]
             Disable assertions. This is the default.
             With no arguments, --ddiissaabblleeaasssseerrttiioonnss or --ddaa disables assertions.
             With one argument ending in ""......"", the switch disables assertions
             in  the specified package and any subpackages. If the argument is
             ""......"", then the switch disables assertions in the unnamed package
             in the current working directory. With one argument not ending in
             ""......"", the switch disables assertions in the specified class.
             To run a program with  assertions  enabled  in  ppaacckkaaggee  ccoomm..wwoomm--
             bbaatt..ffrruuiittbbaatt  but disabled in class ccoomm..wwoommbbaatt..ffrruuiittbbaatt..BBrriicckkbbaatt,
             the following command could be used:

             jjaavvaa --eeaa::ccoomm..wwoommbbaatt..ffrruuiittbbaatt...... --ddaa::ccoomm..wwoommbbaatt..ffrruuiittbbaatt..BBrriicckkbbaatt <<MMaaiinn CCllaassss>>

             The --ddiissaabblleeaasssseerrttiioonnss and --ddaa switches apply to all class  load-
             ers  and  to  system  classes (which do not have a class loader).
             There is one exception to this rule: in their  no-argument  form,
             the  switches  do not apply to system. This makes it easy to turn
             on asserts in all classes except for system  classes.  The  --ddiiss--
             aabblleessyysstteemmaasssseerrttiioonnss  option  provides a separate swith to enable
             assertions in all system classes.

          -enableassertions[:package name"..." | :class name  ],  -ea[:package
          name"..." | :class name ]
             Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by default.
             With no arguments, --eennaabblleeaasssseerrttiioonnss or --eeaa  enables  assertions.
             With  one argument ending in ""......"", the switch enables assertions
             in the specified package and any subpackages. If the argument  is
             ""......"",  then the switch enables assertions in the unnamed package
             in the current working directory. With one argument not ending in
             ""......"", the switch enables assertions in the specified class.
             If   a  single  command  contains  multiple  instances  of  these
             switches, then they are processed in  order  before  loading  any
             classes.  So,  for  example,  to  run  a  program with assertions
             enabled only in package  com.wombat.fruitbat  (and  any  subpack-
             ages), the following command could be used:

             jjaavvaa --eeaa::ccoomm..wwoommbbaatt..ffrruuiittbbaatt...... <<MMaaiinn CCllaassss>>

             The --eennaabblleeaasssseerrttiioonnss and --eeaa switches apply to all class loaders
             and to system classes (which do not have a class  loader).  There
             is  one  exception  to  this rule: in their no-argument form, the
             switches do not apply to system. This makes it easy  to  turn  on
             asserts in all classes except for system classes. The --eennaabblleessyyss--
             tteemmaasssseerrttiioonnss option provides a separate switch to enable  asser-
             tions in all system classes.

          -enablesystemassertions, -esa
             Enable  assertions in all system classes (sets the default asser-
             tion status for system classes to true).

          -disablesystemassertions, -dsa
             Disables assertions in all system classes.

          -help or -?
             Displays usage information and exit.

          -jar
             Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The first argument
             is  the  name  of a JAR file instead of a startup class name. For
             this option to work, the manifest of the JAR file must contain  a
             line  in  the form MMaaiinn--CCllaassss: _c_l_a_s_s_n_a_m_e. Here, _c_l_a_s_s_n_a_m_e identi-
             fies the class with the ppuubblliicc ssttaattiicc  vvooiidd  mmaaiinn((SSttrriinngg[[]]  aarrggss))
             method that serves as your application’s starting point.
             When  you use this option, the JAR file is the source of all user
             classes, and other user class path settings are ignored.
             JAR files that can be run with the  jjaavvaa  --jjaarr  option  can  have
             their  execute  permissions  set so they can be run without using
             jjaavvaa  --jjaarr.   See   _J_A_R   _F_i_l_e   _O_v_e_r_v_i_e_w   at   http://docs.ora-

          -javaagent:jarpath[=options]

          -jre-restrict-search

          -no-jre-restrict-search
             Excludes user-private JREs in the version search.

          -showversion

          -splash:imagepath
             Shows splash screen with image specified by _i_m_a_g_e_p_a_t_h.

          -verbose, -verbose:class
             Displays information about each class loaded.

          -verbose:gc
             Reports on each garbage collection event.

          -verbose:jni
             Reports information about use of native methods and other Java
             Native Interface activity.

          -version
             Displays version information and exits. See also the --sshhoowwvveerrssiioonn
             option.

          -version:release
             Specifies that the version specified by the release is required
             by the class or JAR file specified on the command line. If the
             version of the jjaavvaa command called does not meet this specifica-
             tion and an appropriate implementation is found on the system,
             then the appropriate implementation will be used.
             The rreelleeaassee option specifies an exact version and a list of ver-
             sions called a version string. A version string is an ordered
             list of version ranges separated by spaces. A version range is
             either a _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_i_d, a _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_i_d followed by an asterisk (**), a
             _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_i_d followed by a plus sign (++), or a version range that
             consists of two _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_i_d_s combined using an ampersand (&&). The
             asterisk means prefix match, the plus sign means this version or
             greater, and the ampersand means the logical aanndd of the two ver-
             sion-ranges, for example:

             --vveerrssiioonn::""11..66..00__1133 11..66**&&11..66..00__1100++""

             The meaning of the previous example is that the class or JAR file
             requires either version 1.6.0_13, or a version with 1.6 as a _v_e_r_-
             _s_i_o_n_-_i_d prefix and that is not less than 1.6.0_10. The exact syn-
             tax and definition of version strings can be found in Appendix A
             of the _J_a_v_a _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _L_a_u_n_c_h_i_n_g _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _& _A_P_I _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
             _(_J_S_R_-_5_6_).
             For JAR files, the preference is to specify version requirements
             in the JAR file manifest rather than on the command line.
             See _N_o_t_e_s for important policy information on the use of this
             option.



   NNoonn--SSttaannddaarrdd OOppttiioonnss
          -X Displays information about nonstandard options and exits.

          -Xint
             Operates in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code is
             disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the interpreter. The
             performance benefits offered by the Java HotSpot Client VM adap-
             tive compiler is not present in this mode.

          -Xbatch
             Disables background compilation. Typically, the Java VM compiles
             the method as a background task, running the method in inter-
             preter mode until the background compilation is finished. The
             -Xbatch flag disables background compilation so that compilation
             of all methods proceeds as a foreground task until completed.

          -Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath
             Specifies a colon-separated list of directories, JAR files, and
             ZIP archives to search for boot class files. These are used in
             place of the boot class files included in the Java platform JDK.
             Applications that use this option for the purpose of overriding a
             class in rt.jar should not be deployed because doing so would
             contravene the Java Runtime Environment binary code license.

          -Xbootclasspath/a:path
             Specifies a colon-separated path of directories, JAR files, and
             ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap class path.

          -Xbootclasspath/p:path
             Specifies a colon-separated path of directories, JAR files, and
             ZIP archives to add in front of the default bootstrap class path.
             Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a
             class in rt.jar because this violates the Java Runtime Environ-
             ment binary code license.

          -Xcheck:jni
             Performs additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI) func-
             tions. Specifically, the Java Virtual Machine validates the
             parameters passed to the JNI function and the runtime environment
             data before processing the JNI request. Any invalid data encoun-
             tered indicates a problem in the native code, and the Java Vir-
             tual Machine will terminate with a fatal error in such cases.
             Expect a performance degradation when this option is used.

          -Xfuture
             Performs strict class-file format checks. For backward compati-
             bility, the default format checks performed by the Java virtual
             machine are no stricter than the checks performed by 1.1.x ver-
             sions of the JDK software. The --XXffuuttuurree option turns on stricter
             class-file format checks that enforce closer conformance to the
             class-file format specification. Developers are encouraged to use
             this flag when developing new code because the stricter checks
             will become the default in future releases of the Java applica-
             tion launcher.

          -Xnoclassgc
             Disables class garbage collection. Use of this option preven mem-
             ory recovery from loaded classes thus increasing overall memory
             usage. This could cause OOuuttOOffMMeemmoorryyEErrrroorr to be thrown in some
             applications.

          -Xincgc
             Enables the incremental garbage collector. The incremental
             garbage collector, which is turned off by default, will reduce
             the occasional long garbage-collection pauses during program exe-
             cution. The incremental garbage collector will at times execute
             concurrently with the program and during such times will reduce
             the processor capacity available to the program.

          -Xloggc:file
             Reports on each garbage collection event, as with --vveerrbboossee::ggcc,
             but logs this data to a file. In addition to the information
             --vveerrbboossee::ggcc gives, each reported event will be preceded by the
             time (in seconds) since the first garbage-collection event.
             Always use a local file system for storage of this file to avoid
             stalling the Java VM due to network latency. The file may be
             truncated in the case of a full file system and logging will con-
             tinue on the truncated file. This option overrides --vveerrbboossee::ggcc
             when both are specified on the command line.

          -Xmnsize or -XX:NewSize
             Sets the size of the young generation (nursery).

          -Xmsn
             Specifies the initial size, in bytes, of the memory allocation
             pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024 greater than 1 MB.
             Append the letter kk or KK to indicate kilobytes, or mm or MM to
             indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based
             on system configuration. See _G_a_r_b_a_g_e _C_o_l_l_e_c_t_o_r _E_r_g_o_n_o_m_i_c_s at

             notes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html
             Examples:

             --XXmmss66229911445566
             --XXmmss66114444kk
             --XXmmss66mm


          -Xmxn
             Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation
             pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2 MB.
             Append the letter kk or KK to indicate kilobytes, or mm or MM to
             indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based
             on system configuration.
             For server deployments, --XXmmss and --XXmmxx are often set to the same
             value. See _G_a_r_b_a_g_e _C_o_l_l_e_c_t_o_r _E_r_g_o_n_o_m_i_c_s at http://docs.ora-
             cle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html
             Examples:

             --XXmmxx8833888866008800
             --XXmmxx8811992200kk
             --XXmmxx8800mm

             On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper limit for
             this value is approximately 4000 m minus overhead amounts. On
             Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit is approximately
             2000 m minus overhead amounts. On Linux platforms, the upper
             limit is approximately 2000 m minus overhead amounts.

          -Xprof
             Profiles the running program, and sends profiling data to stan-
             dard output. This option is provided as a utility that is useful
             in program development and is not intended to be used in produc-
             tion systems.

          -Xrs
             Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java VM.
             In an earlier release, the Shutdown Hooks facility was added to
             enable orderly shutdown of a Java application. The intent was to
             enable user cleanup code (such as closing database connections)
             to run at shutdown, even if the Java VM terminates abruptly.
             The Java VM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for unex-
             pected Java VM termination. The Java VM uses SSIIGGHHUUPP, SSIIGGIINNTT, and
             SSIIGGTTEERRMM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.
             The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the feature of
             dumping thread stacks for debugging purposes. The JVM uses
             SSIIGGQQUUIITT to perform thread dumps.
             Applications embedding the Java VM frequently need to trap sig-
             nals such as SSIIGGIINNTT or SSIIGGTTEERRMM, which can lead to interference
             with the Java VM signal handlers. The --XXrrss command-line option is
             available to address this issue. When --XXrrss is used on the Java
             VM, the signal masks for SSIIGGIINNTT, SSIIGGTTEERRMM, SSIIGGHHUUPP, and SSIIGGQQUUIITT are
             not changed by the Java VM, and signal handlers for these signals
             are not installed.
             There are two consequences of specifying --XXrrss:

             o SSIIGGQQUUIITT thread dumps are not available.

             o User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for
               example by calling SSyysstteemm..eexxiitt(()) when the Java VM is to be ter-
               minated.

          -Xssn
             Sets the thread stack size.

          -XX:AllocationPrefetchStyle=n
             Sets the style of prefetch used during allocation. default=2.

          -XX:+AggressiveOpts
             Enables aggressive optimization.

          -XX:+|-DisableAttachMechanism
             Specifies whether commands (such as jjmmaapp and jjccoonnssoollee) can attach
             to the Java VM. By default, this feature is disabled. That is,
             attaching is enabled, for example:

             jjaavvaa --XXXX::++DDiissaabblleeAAttttaacchhMMeecchhaanniissmm


          -XXLargePageSizeInBytes=n
             Specifies the maximum size for large pages.

          -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n
             Sets a target for the maximum GC pause time.
             This is a soft goal, and the Java VM will make its best effort to
             achieve it. There is no maximum value set by default.

          -XX:NewSize
             Sets the size of the young generation (nursery). Sames as --XXmmnn--
             ssiizzee.

          -XX:ParallelGCThreads=n
             Sets the number of GC threads in the parallel collectors.

          -XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=n
             This option requires that the UUnnlloocckkEExxppeerriimmeennttaallVVMMOOppttiioonnss flag be
             set first. Use the PPrreeddiicctteeddCCllaassssLLooaaddCCoouunntt flag if your applica-
             tion loads a lot of classes and especially if ccllaassss..ffoorrNNaammee(()) is
             used heavily. The recommended value is the number of classes
             loaded as shown in the output from --vveerrbboossee::ccllaassss.
             Example:

             jjaavvaa --XXXX::++UUnnlloocckkEExxppeerriimmeennttaallVVMMOOppttiioonnss --XXXX::PPrreeddiicctteeddCCllaassssLLooaaddCCoouunntt==6600001133


          -XX:+PrintCompilation
             Prints verbose output from the Java HotSpot VM dynamic runtime
             compiler.

          -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
             Prints garbage collection output along with time stamps.

          -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0
             This flag enables aggressive processing of software references.
             Use this flag if the software reference count has an impact on
             the Java HotSpot VM garbage collector.

          -XX:TLABSize=n
             Thread local allocation buffers (TLAB) are enabled by default in
             the Java HotSpot VM. The Java HotSpot VM sizes TLABs based on
             allocation patterns. The --XXXX::TTLLAABBSSiizzee option enables fine-tuning
             the size of TLABs.

          -XX:+UseAltSigs
             The Java VM uses SSIIGGUUSSRR11 and SSIIGGUUSSRR22 by default, which can some-
             times conflict with applications that signal-chain SSIIGGUUSSRR11 and
             SSIIGGUUSSRR22. The --XXXX::++UUsseeAAllttSSiiggss option causes the Java VM to use
             signals other than SSIIGGUUSSRR11 and SSIIGGUUSSRR22 as the default.

          -XX:+|-UseCompressedOops
             Enables compressed references in 64-bit Java VMs.
             This option is true by default.

          -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC or -XX:+UseG1GC
             Enables either the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) or the G1 garbage
             collectors.

          -XX:+|-UseLargePages
             Enables large page support.
             Large pages are enabled by default on Solaris.

          -XX:+UseParallelOldGC
             Enables the parallel garbage collectors, which are optimized for
             throughput and average response time.



NNOOTTEESS
       The _-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_:_r_e_l_e_a_s_e option places no restrictions on the complexity of
       the release specification. However, only a restricted subset of the
       possible release specifications represent sound policy and only these
       are fully supported. These policies are:


          1. Any version, represented by not using this option.

          2. Any version greater than an arbitrarily precise _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_-_id value,
             for example:

             ""11..66..00__1100++""

             This would utilize any version greater than 1.6.0_10. This is
             useful for a case where an interface was introduced (or a bug
             fixed) in the release specified.

          3. A version greater than an arbitrarily precise version-id, bounded
             by the upper bound of that release family, for example:

             ""11..66..00__1100++&&11..66**""


          4. An oorr expressions of items 2 or 3, for example:

             ""11..66..00__1100++&&11..66** 11..77++""

             Similar to item 2. This is useful when a change was introduced in
             a release (1.7) but also made available in updates to earlier
             releases.
