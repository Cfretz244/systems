       Subversion  is  a  version control system, which allows you to keep old
       versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log  of
       who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  SSuubb--
       vveerrssiioonn keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy is called
       the  source  ‘‘repository’’;  it contains all the information to permit
       extracting previous versions of those files at any time.

       For more information about the Subversion project, visit http://subver-
