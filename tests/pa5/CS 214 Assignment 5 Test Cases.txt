3.  Database input file does not exist
4.  Book order input files does not exist
5.  Category names input file does not exist (or empty category input string, whichever we prefer)

8.  1 user, 1 book order, out of balance
9.  1 user, multiple book orders, some in balance and some out
10.  1 user, large # book orders from 2-3 categories (test for deadlock)
11.  1 user, small # book orders for 2 categories (test for category-user race condition)
12.  1 user, large # book orders from 1 category (producer-consumer race condition test)
13.  all files empty, except users (should not fail)
14.  4 users, general test
15.  Interleaving test - large orders
