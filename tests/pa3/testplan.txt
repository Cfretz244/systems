Small Testplan:
    Run indexer 4 times, once where the specified output file doesn't exist, one where there's already a file with the specified name,
    one where there's already a directory with the specified name, and once when the specified input doesn't exist. Use the test directory
    for all valid input. Indexer passes this test.

Large Testplan:
    Run indexer through the exact same test cases as with the small testplan, however, this time run it across the entire combined text of
    the Harry Potter and Narnia series. Indexer passes this test.
