Test 1:
    Setup:
        Insert 126 integers into list in order, then iterate across the list to make sure they're in proper order.
    Expected:
        List should be in descending order, so each item should be smaller than the previous.

Test 2:
    Setup:
        Insert 126 strings into list in reverse order, then iterate across the list, deleting random elements as it goes, and makes sure that everything is spat out in order.
    Expected:
        List should be in descending order, so each item should be smaller than the previous.

Test 3:
    Setup:
        Insert 126 integers into list in order, then iterate across the list, deleting the previously seen element (as this exibits worst case runtime behavior) as it goes, and verify order.
    Expected
        List should be in descending order, so each item should be smaller than the previous.

Test 4:
    Setup:
        Insert 126 strings into list in reverse order, then iterate across the liste to verify order.
    Expected:
        List should be in descending order, so each item should be smaller than the previous.
